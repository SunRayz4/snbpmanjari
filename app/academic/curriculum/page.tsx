                  The prime consideration of the school is to maintain a positive learning environment in which pupils can learn, develop and progress.

                  A thematic approach is followed in the Pre-Primary and Junior sections. Evaluation is a continuous process. Grades are awarded and reports are sent to parents once a term ends, so are the answer sheets. A homework period provides for revision and remedial help.
